Why were `rounder()` and `measureRain()` able to use switch cases, while
functions like `happyBirthdayPet()`, `funTypes` were not? Do you prefer `measureRain()` and `rounder()` as `if/else` or `switch` statements?

# Answer

The functions `rounder()` and `measureRain()` were able to use switch cases, while functions like `happyBirthdayPet()`, `funTypes` were not due to the fact that the latter required more complex condition evaluations. For example `happyBirthdayPet()` required a nested conditional evaluation to check for age after checking for breed type. Also, while it is possible to use a `switch` statement with `funTypes`, you can see from the refactored code below that it's not optimal. Refactoring `funTypes` into a `switch` statement was tedious and required writing 10 more lines of code. It is much better suited as an `if/else` not only for this but also because it is checking for many different data types, benefiting from the flexibility of an `if/else` statement.

I prefer `measureRain()` as an `if/else` statement as it requires less code to write compared to as a switch case with many `breaks` required. However, while needing 4 more lines of code, I do prefer `rounder()` as a `switch` statement as it looks cleaner to read and easier to follow.
